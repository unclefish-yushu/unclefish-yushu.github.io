[{"categories":null,"contents":"Uncle Fish\u0026rsquo;s blockchain weekly report brings you a weekly summary of information.\nTime: 10.30 - 11.05\nKeyword of the week: *** Musk, Twitter, rate hike, GALA, HK***\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s big event overview Musk began to push for layoffs after acquiring Twitter; HK is open to the legalization of property rights of token assets; Sun Kuo: TRON and Huobi will actively apply for the HK encryption license; HUSD is seriously de-anchored; Musk’s Twitter map led to a short rise in Doge; The 14th anniversary of the release of the Bitcoin white paper; Affected by the Twitter acquisition, the related MASK, BNB, and DOGE all increased significantly. Binance took the opportunity to launch the BLUEBIRED index; The Fed raises interest rates by 75 basis points; Powell said that the pace of interest rate hikes will be slowed down in the future, starting at the earliest in December; AC\u0026rsquo;s social map suggests a possible comeback. Affected by this, FTM has a short-term increase of 23%; The additional issuance of BSC pGALA, a large number of users carried out arbitrage, and smashed the price on the Huobi platform, resulting in a sharp drop in GALA; Huobi Global stated that it will compensate the loss of the currency holder before the accident, and GALA and pGALA will form two different assets; Weekly Market View 1. The HK encrypted track is catching up This week I think the most important piece of information is that \u0026ldquo;HK has begun to exert its strength on the encryption track\u0026rdquo;. Affected by the epidemic, HK\u0026rsquo;s economy has actually been declining, which can be clearly seen from the trend of Hong Kong stocks.\nIn addition, Singapore, as HK\u0026rsquo;s competitor, took the opportunity to use relatively loose policies to continuously absorb the funds diverted from HK, and Singapore is the first country in Southeast Asia to actively embrace the encryption market, so there are many encryption entrepreneurial teams gathered there.\nWhen a place has money and a lot of creativity, there will be many good projects, at least many of my Singaporean friends will come to me to discuss which web3 project to invest in.\nThis wave of active encryption strategies of HK is actually trying to catch up with Singapore. Although the encryption atmosphere of HK is not as friendly as that of Singapore, HK has the advantage of being backed by the mainland and can actively absorb the good encryption entrepreneurial teams in the mainland. In addition, Sun Que has responded to HK\u0026rsquo;s call for the first time and is ready to bring Tron and Huobi over. After all, talk first and then do it, hot spots still have to be rubbed first.\n2. The BLUEBIRD system soars This week, we can clearly see that the currencies related to the bluebird system have risen sharply. I can only say that \u0026ldquo;the emotions are in place\u0026rdquo;.\nBluebird systems include: MASK, DOGE, BNB. In fact, only MASK is really technically linked to twitter, and the rest are implicit relationships.\nBNB is a potential investor, and Binance provided some of the funding for Musk in the Twitter acquisition, so BNB has benefited from the success of the Twitter acquisition. On social media this week, you can see the crazy interaction between CZ and Musk, they have become good interest partners, and this wave of Twitter acquisitions is a win-win business for both of them.\nThere is no need for me to say more about the sharp rise of the DOGE coin. If Musk is regarded as a company, then doge is the stock issued by this company. Now the holder of DOGE can be understood as a believer or fan of Musk. As for the so-called DOGE can become a tool for rewarding in twitter, or become the so-called web3 first change, I think it is too early. Judging from the current market sentiment, DOGE is completely following Musk\u0026rsquo;s remarks.\nOf course, as the spokesperson of DOGE, Musk is quite responsible for the price of the currency. After the acquisition of Twitter, he specially posted a picture of Blue Bird and Shiba Inu. He is so responsible. Seriously, I cry. die.\n3. Huobi got scammed by GALA In the past two days, the additional issuance of pGALA has really put Huobi into a hole. The thing is, the pNetwork team found out that there is a loophole in the contract deployment of pGALA on BSC, so they thought to recover the money in the pGALA transaction pair first, and then redeploy.\nHow to recover the money in DEX? The team adopted the most violent method, which is to directly issue 1 billion pGALA, and then sell the stablecoin in the pGALA pool by smashing it in the DEX. What kind of situation will this create? That is pGALA will become very cheap.\nAt this time, smart scientists and countless porters discovered a backdoor. pGALA in DEX is very cheap, CEX such as GALA in Huobi is still at a normal price, and the key is that \u0026ldquo;pGALA can be deposited in CEX for trading\u0026rdquo;, the reason is that The p Network team forgot to notify CEX to close the deposit channel.\nThis created the possibility of arbitrage, so the whole network carnival-style transportation began, buying from DEX at low prices and then selling at CEX at high prices, some people made a lot of money because of arbitrage, and some people opened immediately Empty orders are also profitable.\nThe final result is that the GALA team is willing to compensate for the loss of the user amount in CEX, and Huobi Global divides the GALA coins before and after into GALA and pGALA, and pGALA is currently considered a meme coin.\nAccording to my understanding of Sun Que, Huobi may do a secondary development of pGALA. If handled properly, it may become a new meme currency trend. After all, the popularity of this project in the whole network has been raised to a good height.\nSummarize The overall market trended upwards this week. I think the fundamental reason is the Fed\u0026rsquo;s intention to slowly raise interest rates, coupled with the blessing of good news from multiple currency circles, giving people the illusion of a short-term bull market. However, since it is still in the interest rate hike cycle, the upward trend is still very limited, but it can be predicted that the next wave of small outbreaks may start when the Fed reduces the intensity of interest rate hikes.\n","permalink":"https://www.unclefish.link/en/post/wp11-w1/","tags":["weekly report"],"title":"Emotions are in place[Weekly Report]"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello, everyone, I\u0026rsquo;m Uncle Fish. Recently, many Singaporean friends around me have come to ask me \u0026ldquo;how is the web3 startup?\u0026rdquo;, or some investors have asked me \u0026ldquo;Should I invest in the web3 project?\u0026rdquo; .\nRegarding web3, my thoughts are, \u0026ldquo;good things but immature at present, impossible to achieve revolutionary life subversion, and still a niche product for a long time.\u0026rdquo;\nCompared with other people who are advocating that web3 is the future of public opinion, here I want to provide you with another point of view from a negative perspective, so that everyone can think about this topic more comprehensively, rather than blindly following the trend.\nWhat is web3.0 Before starting the discussion of the following topics, we need to clarify the definition of this object. What is web3?\nThe origin of web3 comes from the blockchain network concept proposed by Ethereum Lianchuang and Polkadot founder Dr. Gavin Wood in 2014. Its core idea is to \u0026ldquo;build a decentralized and verifiable network, and this network does not have a core server. It is a distributed Internet where users control their own data.”\nIn short, in the eyes of Dr. Gavin Wood, the core point of web3 is \u0026ldquo;decentralization\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;users control their own data\u0026rdquo;.\nBased on these two characteristics of web3, we will explain web1 and web2 more clearly. web1 refers to the network era in which users obtain data in one direction. In this network, users simply obtain information without interaction, such as early portal websites.\nOn the basis of web1.0, web2.0 adds the function of \u0026ldquo;user interaction\u0026rdquo;. In short, it means that users generate content, and users consume content generated by other users through interaction. The representative application of such products is \u0026ldquo;social media\u0026rdquo;. , such as Weibo, Douyin, etc. It is worth mentioning that in web 2.0, the data content generated by users is owned by the platform. For example, Douyin increases its own value through the use of a large number of users, and uses users\u0026rsquo; data to obtain benefits, while users cannot. Get a piece of the pie. Therefore, the characteristic of web2.0 is that \u0026ldquo;users generate data, users consume data, but users do not own data\u0026rdquo;.\nFrom the previous characteristics of web3.0, it can be known that its biggest improvement compared to web2.0 is \u0026ldquo;letting users really own data\u0026rdquo;, and the way it is implemented is to build a decentralized blockchain network. The central operator ensures that user data is not mastered by the central agency, thus ensuring data ownership. The most successful application of this type is Ethereum, which is actually the best example of the current web3.0.\nIt is too early for web3.0 to replace web2.0 Some time ago, I listened to a web3.0 entrepreneur\u0026rsquo;s sharing session in a group. When he talked about why he chose this track, there were three main reasons:\nAt present, the web2.0 opportunities have been divided up by the Internet giants, and there is a bottleneck in the rise; web3.0 is still in the early stage, the current application is very rough, and there are many opportunities; Some time ago, the bull market aroused everyone\u0026rsquo;s desire and felt that web 3.0 was the outlet. These three reasons are very real, and the core point is that web3.0 \u0026ldquo;has the opportunity to create wealth\u0026rdquo;. However, at present, most of the entrepreneurial methods are still stuck in the hard transfer of the existing functions of web2.0 to web3.0, such as decentralized music listening, decentralized social networking, decentralized film and television and so on.\nI do not deny the value of these innovations, but from the user\u0026rsquo;s point of view, these applications are difficult to separate people who are already familiar with the way web2.0 interacts.\nSimply take WeChat for comparative case analysis, why do you use WeChat? Very simple, because the people around are using it. Then why did the earliest group of people give up QQ and choose WeChat? The core point is that WeChat is easy to use, which refers to the ease of use, registration, and functions. In other words, the learning cost for users is very low. Basically, as long as you have a mobile phone number, you can sign up for WeChat and add friends to start chatting.\nIn contrast to decentralized social networking, if you want to use it, you need a wallet, you need to register the wallet and remember the mnemonic. In addition, in the interaction of blockchain applications, the gas fee is essential, maybe you send an emoji , there is a fee for sending a sentence. These inconveniences actually greatly increase the learning cost of users. Compared with data privatization, more users may pay more attention to \u0026ldquo;convenience and efficiency\u0026rdquo;. The essence of web2.0 is that users surrender their privacy in exchange for free and fast services, but there is no free lunch in the world, and users themselves have actually become commodities sold by the platform. ***\nWhen everyone\u0026rsquo;s data protection awareness is not improved, the threat of web3.0 to web2.0 can be said to be minimal.\nThe mobile Internet has achieved web2.0, and mobile digital wallets may have achieved web3.0 Why has Douyin and Weibo Kuaishou developed rapidly in recent years? The superficial reason is that the big Internet companies are willing to spend money and are willing to spend money on advertising and subsidizing users, but the essential reason is that the rapid development of mobile devices has greatly reduced the cost of information dissemination.\nTen years ago, you wanted to use your mobile phone to watch videos and swipe Weibo. It was a luxury, because expensive data charges and unsmart mobile phones greatly reduced your experience. However, the cost of smart machines is getting lower and lower, the performance is getting higher and higher, and the data package of hundreds of gigabytes at every turn has provided a solid hardware foundation for the development of web2.0. All in all, the success of web2.0 is inseparable from the development and progress of mobile devices.\nBy referring to the success of web2.0, we can think about what is needed for the success of web3.0. In fact, it is obvious that how to make digital wallet hardware convenient is a problem that must be faced in the development of web 3.0, and its best solution is to directly integrate into the ecology of smart phones.\nHere I provide a possible idea to embed the digital wallet into the mobile phone in the form of a chip, so that when the user buys a mobile phone, he will directly obtain a hardware wallet, and based on this wallet, he can quickly and easily enter the web3.0. This hardware-based wallet method can solve the problem of user learning cost well.\nCoincidentally, my friend who works in a blockchain investment company has already started investing in digital hardware wallets. I believe that many big manufacturers have also seen the prospects in this field. Therefore, my suggestion is to think about how to work hard in the infrastructure of web 3.0 instead of desperately stuffing content into web 3.0.\nToken Economics, the lifeblood of web3.0 Does web3.0 need to issue coins? I think it is inevitable.\nHere I briefly describe an economic model of web2.0. Usually a web2.0 wants to quickly occupy the market, the project party behind it must have enough funds to attract users, usually in the form of subsidies. The early Internet projects basically relied on the behavior of burning money to occupy the market, and the investors behind them were financially strong.\nWhen the market is almost occupied, the platform will start to increase fees, or use targeted advertising to make profits, and users cannot easily get rid of the application after they have a strong stickiness, so the current scene is reached. \u0026ldquo;Convenience by surrendering privacy\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the profit model of web2.0 above, we can find that whether it is early market occupation or advertising profit after occupation of the market, there will be a central body behind it. However, on the other hand, web3.0 does not have such a central organization, so what is its sustainable profit model?\nThe core point of the economic model of web 3.0 is to issue tokens, that is, to issue coins. In the early days, users will generally be attracted to use the application by means of airdrops and rewards. Later, when users have a large number of the tokens, users will be bound to the project unconsciously. Thus, both parties benefit from the token appreciation. Of course how to design a good token economic model is the key, because too many projects fail due to inappropriate token models.\nSummarize Finally, to briefly summarize, the increased popularity of web 3.0 has the advantage of letting more people know what web 3.0 is, thereby raising awareness of data protection, but the downside is that it is easy to introduce many investment traps. I hope everyone can be more vigilant.\n","permalink":"https://www.unclefish.link/en/post/%E5%BD%93%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%83%BD%E5%9C%A8%E7%82%92web3.0%E6%97%B6%E6%88%91%E8%A6%81%E7%BB%99%E5%AE%83%E6%B5%87%E4%B8%AA%E5%86%B7%E6%B0%B4/","tags":["web3"],"title":"When everyone is crazy about web3.0, I'm going to pour cold water on it"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\n状态：已读完；\n类别：财经 / 自我提升；\n推荐程度：4.8/5 「强烈推荐」\n一句话短评：有种「原则」和「穷查理宝典」合集的韵味，后劲十足值得反复阅读。\n内容简介 一个成功投资人关于财富和幸福的思考。\n作者 埃里克是产品策略师和作家。2011年，他加入了Zaarly的创始团队。他的商业博客Evergreen，粉丝超过百万。他作为陌生人收集和整理了纳瓦尔发表于Twitter等自媒体平台的文章、语录，汇编成这本书，在征求了纳瓦尔的首肯后正式出版。\n书籍电子版下载链接 纳瓦尔宝典\n内容摘录 Wealth Part 《The Almanack of Navel Ravikant》- understand how wealth is created\nMaking Money is not a thing You do \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s a skill you learn. Knowing the direction you should work on is much more important than purely hard work. Money is not wealth. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Renting our time is not a good way to get rich. You will get rich by giving society what it wants but not yet know how to get. learn to build, learn to sell, then you will be unstoppable. Fortune requires leverage. If you don’t have capital, you can try something with no marginal cost of replication, like code and media. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it, otherwise, you are just a worker. Code and media are permission-less leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep There is no skill called 「Business」, let\u0026rsquo;s study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computer. The difference between Money and wealth Summary : leverage (code and media), wealth and money , specific knowledge, 《The Almanack of Navel Ravikant》- Find and build specific knowledge\nSpecific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned. The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. If you find something you don’t understand , you need to figure out what the foundation required for this kind of knowledge. Foundations are super important, that’s the reason why you need to learn several fields’ information. Don’t try master everything, you can only achieve mastery in one or two things. When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly. The real wealth is created by starting your own companies or even by investing. when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. There are three kinds of leverage - labour , Money, Products with no marginal cost of replication.（没有边际效应的产物源自印刷） If they pay you what you’re worth, you can get your time back. 如果你会做产品，又会做品牌，那你就是无敌的。 Earn with your mind, not your time. 书中作者给了一个修缮房子的例子来解释「杠杆人生」：初级水泥匠，只需要对自己的老板负责，按时薪挣钱；承包商，对客户负责，赚取收入和成本的差价，需要承担一定的风险；开发商，可能手下有很多的承包商，对接多个老房子的买卖和翻新，它在承包商的基础上进一步增加了杠杆，并且需要更多的信用；基金公司，他们负责对这类开发 商进行投资，他们有许多的资本杠杆；一个综合的房地产公司，旗下综合了房地产开发和融资等多个功能。想清楚自己要到哪一步。 《The Almanack of Navel Ravikant》\nRely on the output rather than input. Small difference in judgement and capability really get amplified 巴菲特的决策为什么被人信任，因为他正确了很多次，不断放大了人们对他的信任，这也是信任杠杆的体现。他的投资人不会催促他现在该干什么，一会儿该干什么，他们信任他，而巴菲特也因这个信任获得了自由。 wealth cannot be created by one-off thing, it’s calculated gradually. There are two kinds of games: Money game and Status game. Money game is a positive-sum game, status game is a zero-sum game. Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired. Freedom is my destination. 现实中有四种可能的幸运成分：1）纯粹意义上的运气；2）基于努力工作获得的幸运；3）深耕于某一个领域，能比其他人更早发现机会的运气；4）做到一个领域的极致，机会就主动来找你。 You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. you get rich by saving your time to make money. If you cannot explain it to a child, then you don’t know it . If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you are lost. You’re just memorizing. It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are. The means of learning are abundant — it’s the desire to learn that is scarce. 个人反思：\n“If you are a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term-thinking dealmaker, when other people want to do deals but don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal just because of the integrity and reputation you’ve built up.\n”\n这也是我一直想做的，当我拥有影响力和名誉的时候，机会就会主动来找我。\n“Go struggle. It is hard. I’m not going to say it’s easy. It’s really hard, but the tools are all available. It’s all out there.”\n“The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be.”\n在看待客观事物时不要先入为主\n当你做决策感受到痛苦时，你可能在接受现实。\n“The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say it. ”\n有时候个人的渴望情绪会干扰自己的判断，阻止我们看到真实的现状。这个在我投资的过程是不是也经常出现，有时候市场低迷该抛售的时候，我却不愿意抛售，不愿正视现状。做正确的决定，比做很多决定来得更重要。\nHappiness Part happiness can be cultivated by lots of techniques.(I guess happiness is peace) Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. It is what you feeling matters, affecting your emotion. Your happiness is your choice, and that reflects how you treat the world. A lot of our unhappiness comes from comparing things from the past to present. Maybe you actually don’t need a thing, you just enjoy the feeling of desire. we mistake the feeling of desire as happiness and joy. The fundamental delusion: there is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.(The true happiness can only be found from inside not outside.) Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. In our life, we struggle with three things: Money, Health, Time. Envy is the enemy of happiness. We used to think life is a multiplayer game, but actually it’s a single-player game purely. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. Perhaps one reason why yoga and meditation are hard to sustain is they have no extrinsic value. Purely single-player games, which make us afraid of. Long term benefit habits are more likely to bring you happiness. 《The Almanack of Naval Ravikant》- Saving yourself\nThere is something outside just for you. Our bodies don’t know how to say no to drugs, to sugar, to alcohol. It’s based on our DNA. The combination of sugar and fat together is really deadly. World’s simplest diet: the more processed the food, the less one should consume. The important thing is to do something every day, it doesn’t matter what it is. Easy choice, Hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Two much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind. Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit. Maybe I should try a long time meditation. To have peace of mind, you have to have peace of body first. Read the basics, get the original information. You may read one hundreds regurgitated books on evolution but without reading Darwin. You may have read tons of treatises in economics but haven’t read any Adam Smith. Your time is all you have. Do not waste your time. Philosophy\nWhat is the meaning of life? The author suggest three answers: 1) it is personal. 2) There is no meaning to life. 3) The Universe is going to be disorder, eventually we will be in a heat death situation, our life is just a progress to accelerate the heat death of universe.(关于作者的第三点生命意义还是挺有意思的，世界就是不断从有序变向无序，这是一个熵不断变大的过程，而我们的生命其实是一个逆熵的过程，我们创造了很多有序的系统和物质，但是对于整个地球来说我们其实加速了地球的衰变过程，同样对于宇宙来说，我们的一生也加速了宇宙的熵变) Don’t believe short-term thinking or dealing. Wisdom: Understanding the long-term consequences of your actions. 读书心得 完成这本书的阅读后，内心也轻松了不少，因为英文版阅读确实有一定压力，不过个人阅读能力也进步不少。「纳瓦尔宝典」这本书给我的感觉像是「原则」和「穷查理宝典」的结合，里面涉及到的内容很广泛也很深刻，从投资讲到生活再讲到哲学，像是一本工具书，你缺少什么就可以在里面找到什么。\n关于投资，书中提倡地是将你的专长，按照一个无需边际成本的方式去发展，用杠杆去撬动你的人生，这类方式可以是媒体，可以是代码，也可以是文字。在自己的领域做到极致，那么机会自然而然会到来。\n关于幸福，每个人的幸福理解都会有所不同，因为这是一个很私人的感受。不过幸福不能依托于外在事物，它是一个由内部产生的能量，作者认为幸福就是心中的平静，这一点我很认同，结合我在心学里所体会到的，所有的感受都来自于内心，心静则可以印万物。\n如何实现心灵的平静，在哲学这一章中作者强调了冥想的作用，冥想就是一个很古怪的东西，你不尝试之前永远觉得这玩意儿是门玄学，但是尝试后却又有意外收获。不过，这里作者的习惯是冥想一个小时，这我目前还做不到，不过可以之后尝试延长时间。在哲学上，作者认为自己信奉的是「理性佛学」，依托于现代科学和进化论来看待佛学中的内容，从中提炼出自己想要的内容，比如如何成为更好的人，抑或如何打坐修身等等。\n最后，简单谈一下自己从中得到的最大收获，在阅读过程中我对人生的短暂和意义产生了思考，觉得当下的每一分每一秒都很珍贵，当我们把眼光拉长到整个历史来看，个人的小小一生其实微不足道，如何把自己的生活过精彩也许是每一个人都该思考的问题。不要拘泥于眼前短暂的利益，长远的收获才会升华你的人生。最后，多读书，我觉得书籍是可以让你的短暂人生继承下无穷智慧的工具。\n放入书中提到的书单（我个人觉得有兴趣的）：\n《无穷的开始：世界进步的本源》 戴维·多伊奇 《人类简史》 尤瓦尔·赫拉利 《理性乐观派：一部人类经济进步史》，马特·里德利 《主权个体：把握向信息时代的过渡》（The Sovereign Individual:Mastering the Transition to the Information Age），詹姆斯·戴尔·戴维森、威廉·里斯-莫格勋爵 《悉达多》 《沉思录》马可·奥勒留 《先知》纪伯伦 《雪崩》尼尔 斯蒂芬森 《物种起源》 达尔文 《国富论》亚当斯密 ","permalink":"https://www.unclefish.link/en/read/%E7%BA%B3%E7%93%A6%E5%B0%94%E5%AE%9D%E5%85%B8/","tags":["财经"],"title":"纳瓦尔宝典"},{"categories":null,"contents":"hello，大家好，我是鱼叔。\n21年我试运营了一个咨询群，已经满一年。期间很多朋友都有所收获，令我欣慰的是越来越的读者不再盲目跟风，知道如何从理性地角度去思考区块链项目的价值。\n今年我开始将咨询群迁移到微信群中，以方便大家更好地沟通，这个群主要用于分享项目研究结果，以及解答朋友们的疑惑，还是那句话，「我不能让你暴富，但是我能让你少走弯路。」\n本群适合的人群：\n对区块链感兴趣并且愿意学习 觉得鱼叔的内容还不错 对合约失去信心，想玩现货的人 想入群的朋友可以加微信uncle_fish_123，或者在知乎中私信我，目前暂定费用为149元。\n注意：我不会带单，所有带你炒合约的都是骗子。\n鱼叔简介 “我是鱼叔，一个理性的投资者” 知乎「区块链投资」资深创作者\n巴比特海盗号作者\nImToken ETH2.0 征文比赛一等奖获得者\n公众号 鱼叔的币圈江湖\n","permalink":"https://www.unclefish.link/en/tool/%E4%BB%98%E8%B4%B9%E6%A0%8F%E7%9B%AE/","tags":null,"title":"[付费栏目]鱼叔的咨询群"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello, everyone, I’m Uncle Fish. This article may be a little sensitive, and I may encounter 404. As a researcher of a blockchain project, I still want to express my feelings about some things in Shanghai.\nIn order to avoid too much being harmonized, I will use some words here instead. SH, April Sound\nBackground Fuse — April Sound I’ve been at home in SH for almost a month, and a lot of emo’s have happened in this month. At first, most of the bad news was circulated within SH citizens, but with the rapid spread of the Internet, these news have been circulated through the circle of friends. , WeChat groups, Weibo and other media have spread rapidly. At least my friends from other provinces often ask me if I have anything to eat, instead of blindly believing in the news that \u0026ldquo;materials are abundant\u0026rdquo;.\nIn order to avoid the excessive spread of news, the authorities adopted a rude method, directly asking the company behind the corresponding media to control the corresponding communication content and not display it. Therefore, when we click on a lot of videos and articles, we will find a lot of \u0026ldquo;violating content will not be displayed\u0026rdquo;, or directly 404 not found. But the wisdom of the people is unlimited, and various ways of saving pictures or re-encoding videos for re-distribution, this kind of tug-of-war in dissemination will undoubtedly consume everyone\u0026rsquo;s trust in ZF.\nYesterday, a video clip of the emo incident in SH this month was circulated on the Internet, and it was forwarded wildly in the circle of friends. To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve watched this video, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much impact on me personally, because I\u0026rsquo;ve watched too many emo things, and I\u0026rsquo;ve developed immunity to this kind of news. At least in my opinion, this video is actually a creator who recorded the events at this stage. When we promote positive energy, we should also face up to these negative energies and take this as a lesson.\nHowever, after this video survived for about 10 hours, it began to be blocked in various ways. A feeling of suffocation that seemed to be strangling the throat began to spread in the circle of friends, so various counterattacks, ridicules, and even various voices followed one after another. Maybe the next The authorities who ordered it did not expect such a violent reaction from the masses, and he may have asked for the video to be deleted without watching it at all. Squeezing out a flame has aroused the enthusiasm of the public for creation, and all kinds of similar creations swept in. When you are on the opposite side of the public, you may face a stormy sea.\nThe rights behind Web2 and web3 After talking about the background, let\u0026rsquo;s put aside the essence of emotional regression technology, where is the control behind web2 and web3?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s briefly talk about the origin of the web. The earliest Internet was called a portal website, also known as web1. The feature of this web1 is that users are the recipients of data, and you can get whatever information is on the web page without interaction; when it comes to web2 After that, data interaction occurred, and users were no longer data passives. Basically, the content generated by users became the data subject. For example, the content on Weibo was generated by users themselves; in web3, users own the data content generated by themselves, and the platform Need to apply for data usage.\nWe mainly discuss web2 and web3 here. After some introductions above, it may be difficult for some people to notice the difference between web3 and web2. Here I will give an example. Facebook sold user data to Cambridge Research without user consent. The center then sparked a lawsuit. In this case, Facebook is a representative of web2. It has a large amount of user data. In theory, these data are generated by users and owned by users, but in fact these data are stored in Facebook\u0026rsquo;s servers, and it can call these data at any time. Analysis, the value and benefits generated by these analysis are not enjoyed by users, just like WeChat can send you targeted advertisements by searching your chat records, Taobao can push products to you through your search records, in other words, you Streaking in web2, those big factories are making money with your nude photos (the words are not rude).\nSome people may say that when using the app, isn\u0026rsquo;t it required to agree to some privacy content? Can\u0026rsquo;t you use this to protect your own rights? The protection of privacy rights is a soft method. I guess only 10% of people have really studied these rights and interests, while the rest agree to it without reading it at all. Some manufacturers even deliberately write complicated protocols and turn off ads recommended. The function is extremely hidden (it is a letter), and the manufacturer has even trained a lot of consultants to write privacy agreements to exploit the loopholes in the law and try to find the last shred of profit as much as possible.\nResearch on web2 will find that behind all applications there is a centralized organization that has the power to easily delete your data and content. How can you fundamentally ensure your own data ownership? Choose a decentralized network, which is the direction of web3 development - allowing users to control their own data.\nThe trade-off between centralization and decentralization The advantage of a centralized network is efficiency. When you have a large amount of data, you can break through the data barriers and conduct analysis to obtain higher value. But again, a centralized network creates \u0026ldquo;privacy issues\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rights abuse issues.\u0026rdquo; Where is that metric when you have the ability to decide what content to show and what not to show. When Trump was running for president, he was accused of using Twitter targeting to deliver campaign ads to influence voters to make objective decisions, and he also \u0026ldquo;ruled the country on Twitter\u0026rdquo; during his tenure, but his Twitter account was immediately blocked after he took office. , it can be seen that the centralized network really serves the regime, which is the same all over the world.\nThe biggest problem of the decentralized network is that it is not mature enough. The number of applications of web3 is still difficult to compare with that of web2, but some basic media functions and financial functions can still meet the needs. Another point is that the current threshold for web3 is too high, it is destined that the number of users of this decentralized network will be difficult to increase. This is a dilemma. Creators will use web2 in order to increase their influence, because there are more users here, but web2 There must be centralized supervision, and your creative content needs to comply with the regime’s norms, otherwise it will inevitably be constrained.\nWhen the audience of web3 is as large as that of web2, data and speech can truly be mastered by themselves.\nHow I embraced web3 As an old leek, I have been deeply attracted to the crypto world and web3 has become a part of my life. When I browse the web, I will use Brave; when I invest, I will be more inclined to Defi; when I write articles, I will back up a copy to ICP; when I publish, in addition to Zhihu, official account, Medium These web2 media, I will also publish on Mirror (blockchain blog). It can be said that at this stage, I can\u0026rsquo;t completely break away from web2, but I am actively trying web3. Sometimes it is very interesting to think that my content can persist on the blockchain forever.\nLast The residents of SH are actually locked up insane. If you force 404 to solve all problems, it will only lead to more emotional dissatisfaction. Proper guidance and a positive public response are what the official media needs to do.\nIn April, if you are silent and decorate peace, you can only shout.\n","permalink":"https://www.unclefish.link/en/post/%E4%BB%8E%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E5%8C%96%E8%A7%92%E5%BA%A6%E6%8E%A2%E8%AE%A8web3%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%B7%E5%80%BC/","tags":["web3"],"title":"Discuss the value of web3 from the perspective of decentralization"},{"categories":null,"contents":"hello，大家好，我是鱼叔，这篇文章是我2021年的投资回顾，这篇文章主要分成三个部分：\n2021 币圈发生的大事统计 鱼叔的投资策略及变化思路 未来2020可能的板块预期 这篇文章我断断续续地写了有一个月，正好趁这个不景气的行情下好好收拾心情反思自己的投资策略，希望这篇报告能带给你启发。\n最近开设了公众号【鱼叔的币圈江湖】，有兴趣的朋友可以关注\n2021币圈大事统计 前言 2021年注定是动荡的一年，伴随着防疫工作的效果体现，各国经济也开始复苏，美国依旧大水灌溉，导致全球都处于一个宽松政策。对于币圈来说，2021更是起伏像过山车般的一年，在这一年里机遇和挑战并存，有的人在动物币的疯狂中高喊“狗狗币万岁”，也有的人在政策规范下被迫将矿场迁移到国外，波动在币圈里是一个很常见的现象，但是在今年显得格外突出。另外，【合规】是今年币圈里的另一大话题，伴随着象征币圈第一股的Coinbase成功上市，SEC的监管也如期而至，甚至DEX也难逃监管，从某种意义上来说合规是为了让去中心化社区更好的发展。\n在这一年里，很多大V开始加入这个领域做最酷的踏浪儿，其中最知名的就是马斯克，作为币圈第一流量，他的twitter往往会在市场上掀起腥风血雨，但是这一年里由于他阴晴不定的立场，导致其影响力也逐渐下降。\n如果说去年的主题是「Defi」，那么今年的主题肯定是「NFT」，由NFT衍生的一系列产品可太火了，甚至都火出了圈，包括元宇宙这个概念也从币圈开始衍生到了外界，Facebook甚至改名成「Meta」来明志，当然扎克伯格的野心可能会更大。\n这一年，监管、疯狂、艺术、公链竞争等等，都给这个迷幻的市场增加了很多的魅力，我热爱这个市场，因为这里从来不缺乏奇迹，就像一片西部荒地等待大家去开拓，但是这片土地又充满着危机，稍有不慎就会损失惨重，如何能让自己像一个牛仔驰骋在这片领域里，提高认知做好风险控制才是一个理性投资者所应该做的。\n记于

这一年其实经历了很多，无数的项目崛起也有无数的项目没落，一地鸡毛后真正剩下的是什么，不言而喻。这一年里我投资了大约有十个项目，亏损了三个项目，这一年里我开始认真思考和研究投资，相信提高认知才是最好的捷径，这一年里我看了有三十多本书，并且逐渐形成自己的投资策略，这一年里我尝试输出和写作，用一种外在的力量来督促自己不断地进步。\n一、那些失败的投资教训 我没有大家想象中那么神，我也有失败的投资经历，我希望用这段失败的经历可以让大家有所收获，避免走同样的错误。其实失败并不可怕，有些错误只有犯过了才会知道如何提高和调整。\n杠杆代币其实也是有风险的。 在交易所的代币list中会有一些自带杠杆的代币，通常在三倍到十倍之前，这种代币可以理解为是一种ETF，内部其实是由一系列的合约组成，虽然这种代币不会有爆仓的风险，但是这个币价会随波动大起大落，只适合单边行情，也许你会发现昨天跌幅了10%，今天需要涨15%才能恢复到原有的币价，而长期持有则会不断吞噬你的币价，切记不可长期持有。\n不要追逐热点 今年我追逐过很多的热点项目，比如FIL、XCH、ICP等，这些项目的通性都是前期炒作特别厉害，厉害到什么程度呢？厉害到出圈，甚至是一些不了解加密世界的朋友都知道硬盘最近因为挖矿要涨价了。我知道里面可能有泡沫，但是我总觉得自己可以和泡沫共舞（Dance with bubble），可是我高估了自己的能力，因为这种smart money不适合散户参与，风险太高了，其实反向思考就可以知道，为什么这些热点消息会不断推送到你的眼前？因为有资本在不断宣传和推广，资本是嗜血的，它们在撒网，而我们就是它们要捕捞的鱼。如何避免被抓？那就是不去追逐热点，热点很美好很传神，但是也很烫手。\n不要尝试去投资挖矿 作为散户，除非你有很多的资本否则不要尝试去挖矿，因为挖矿的投入是个无底洞，它不像表面描述的那么稳定，如果你去买显卡挖矿，那你会面临高电耗、高噪音等生活环境问题，如果你去买矿机，那就水更深了，因为你不知道你买到的是几手矿机。另外，一定要警惕所谓的云挖矿，你可能觉得花钱租个机子云挖矿，赚个稳定的收益似乎是一件不错的理财方式，但是你要意识到这整个过程全都依赖于矿主的个人素质，如果他把挖出来的币都占为己有，那么你就是陪了夫人又折兵。我今年在Chia最火的时候倒腾了很多的硬盘来挖矿，最后发现算力根本竞争不过大户矿池，看着日益增长的全网算力，我就放弃了，除非是非常早期的挖矿，否则当资本进入的时候小散户是完全没法抗衡的。\n网格交易没你想得那么好 我在今年玩了两个月左右的网格交易，后来查看了一下收益分成就决定放弃了，因为大部分的钱其实都被交易所给挣走了。这里简单科普一下网格交易，网格交易就是交易所给用户提供的一种“量化投资”方式，你选择一个区间范围，然后由机器人按照你给定的价格间隔进24h交易。听起来很不错，似乎有一个机器人帮你操作就可以高枕无忧地赚钱了，实际上这种网格交易只适合波动向上的行情，而且如果行情超出了你的价格范围，你就可能会错过大行情。最重要的一点是，当你用机器人不断交易的时候，你的收益很大一部分是被交易所作为手续费给收取的，为什么交易所无偿给你提供一个交易策略？引用硅谷有名的一句话「当你免费使用产品的时候，你就是产品」\n过多的信息来源会让人忙乱 我早期也喜欢加入各种群，加的多了就发现有用的信息量极少反而市场噪音过分的大，甚至说有些项目为了割韭菜故意在各种群里安插“演员”，这种套路我上过一次两次后就免疫了。通常群里会有一个负责宣传的，一个负责捧哏的，接下去就会抛出一个新的二维码拉群，然后新群里演员就更多了，这时候往往会冒出一个工作人员或者“大佬”来给大家投资建议，随后紧跟几个“信徒”，说持有一年肯暴富之类的话，你问他们为什么这么坚定持有，他们也说不上来就无非是“梭哈”、“大不了s了算了”活跃气氛的话。因此我现在没有加任何投资群，也不主张建立微信群，因为我不希望这种无用的信息干扰我的读者，此外投资这种事本来就是孤独的，需要自己独立思考，虽千万人吾往矣。\n分散投资其实是一个骗局 我们从小都学习一个道理，“不要把鸡蛋放在一个篮子里”，说的就是分散风险，很多人自然而然地把这个道理挪用到投资上，但往往会发现自己整体的收益并不出色。其实这是一个最大的投资误区，风险分散的同时你也会把收益给拉低，越是分散的投资，整体的收益就越是趋向于市场大盘的均值，就相当于人为地搞了个一个基金。通常你会发现，有一两个项目的收益特别好，但是其他的项目拖了后腿，导致整体收益也就那样。如何摆脱这样的困境？学习巴菲特的方法，“选择一个好项目，然后重仓”，其实所有出色的投资者都是依靠眼光独到才获得高额收益的，而不是靠分散投资。当然这里的前提是，你要去做研究，去重仓你觉得值得的项目，另外不建议重仓的同时还加杠杆，风险极高。\n二、我是如何从短线变成长线的 老实说，我也曾是一个短线投机者，我常常为了盯盘在电脑面前一坐就是一天，从盯着时线到半小时线，再到十五分钟线甚至到一分钟线。如果你看我的k线图，你会发现密密麻麻的各种划痕，无非就是大家熟悉的那套k线理论。你说我这一天不断的交易挣得很多吗？其实并没有，一天下来我的眼睛布满血丝，但是我的收益可能只有1%。\n虽然收益很小，但是为什么很多人就是摆脱不了想交易的欲望呢？因为短线交易能给你带来即时的反馈，你可以立马知道自己做的这个决策是对的还是错的，这种快节奏的反馈能让人上瘾，就像打游戏一样，但是市场往往没法在短线里展现趋势，如果你钻到了细节里，就可能会错过更加长远的利益。\n真正让我摆脱短线的是有一天我意识到，因为投资我的生活没了。币圈是24h不间断的，你不可能把握住每一个赚钱的时刻，我投资的目的是希望让资金滚动起来，让它给我打工，而不是我需要盯盘为它打工。当意识到这一点时，我豁然开朗，就像种树一样，你需要给你的决策一点时间，你需要用时间来证明你的认知，你的判断。人不可能买在最低点，卖在最高点，真正的投资家可能50%的时间用于生活，45%的时间都用于项目研究，而5%的时间才用于操作。这让我想起了大投机家安德烈·科斯托拉尼的一句话，投资是一门艺术的活，既然是艺术就不要时刻神经紧绷，放长线钓大鱼才是该有的态度。\n当你把眼光从小时线移到日线，甚至是周线的时候，你就会看到市场给你呈现了不一样的东西，那种东西叫做“趋势”，这就是长线投资给你带来最好的礼物，而短线你看到的东西叫做“情绪”，你在和数以万计跟你一样死盯k线操作的散户玩一个“零和游戏”。\n三、坚定一个你认可的投资策略，即使别人嘲笑你 今年我写了一篇关于不认可Shib的文章，表示不看好这种meme币，结果各路网友评论说我打脸。我承认，shib的增长是超出我预期的，我接触到这个币的时候它还处于价格挺低的位置，但是由于其不符合我的一套价值判断体系，因此我也就没怎么考虑它，当然它后来的走势也确实“打我的脸”。\n你说我后悔吗？一点都不，甚至我还庆幸自己没买。虽然错过了这一次暴涨，但是我坚持了自己的判断体系，没有跟风，这一点对于我来说就无比可贵。加密市场有很多这样的机会，也有很多号称机会的“机会”，你必须要有一套自己的理论才能确保不被浪潮卷走。同样的，你不可能把握住每一次风口，不要老是在他人高盈利的诱惑下匆匆换仓，结果买在高位给别人接盘。人定胜天，用足够强的认知和信念去持有，终将会迎来属于你的“Shib”。\n2022年可能需要关注的六大板块 在这个章节里，我会描述一下2022年我认为值得关注的一些板块。\nWeb3.0 web3 在2021年的年末掀起了一波讨论热潮，不断有大咖在给其站位，也有大咖在贬低web3，认为这是一个骗人的套话，究竟什么是web3.0，其实很难给出一个明确的定义，因为它包含的内容太广了，在解释web3之前，我们先来回顾一下1.0和2.0。\nweb1.0是最早期的互联网形式，通常表现为网站提供内容，用户根据自己的需求去接受对应的内容，比如早期的门户网站，web1.0最大的特点是内容导向形，也就是说在1.0的互联网模式下，内容数小于用户数。\nweb2.0相比于1.0最大的不同在于从「内容导向」到「用户导向」的转变，也就是说在2.0的互联网，用户不再是被动地接受信息，相应的，用户成为内容的产出者，这类特征最明显的应用就是社交网络。\n关于web3.0，早期的互联网人认为web3就是结合人工智能的信息流，从「人去找信息」变成「信息主动来找你」，但是随着区块链的发展，业界人士觉得结合AI的互联网并没有带来革命性的改变，与其说是3.0不如说是web2.1。那什么是3.0？其实3.0包含的范围特别广，它的核心点在于「数据私有化」。什么叫做「数据私有化」，简单来讲就是外界需要获得你的许可才能访问你的数据，最明显的产品就是我们常用的dapp。可能你会觉得Dapp和普通的app使用起来没有什么区别，但是你要知道这里底层的逻辑是不同的，在Dapp里数据是你私有的，没有你的授权运营商甚至是项目团队都无法获取，而在普通的app里你的数据是由第三方托管的，甚至说那些公司正拿着你的数据赚钱，而你却一点都不知道。\n想象一下未来有一个基于web3.0构建的互联网世界，在这个世界里你同样享受到类似于现在的app，比如社交app、流媒体app、数据存储app等，因此未来web3可以关注一下搭建此类相关生态的项目。\nLayer2 和ETH2.0 以太坊依旧是目前最火的生态，为了进一步扩展以太坊的性能，layer2和eth2.0成为了未来可行性较高的方案。L2是中间方案，eth2.0是终极方案，22年必然这两个相关的项目会有更加不错的发展。\n跨链和各大公链生态 21年注定是solana的年份，作为21年最火的生态，solana伴随着NFT的热风一路将币价冲进了前十。但是这个世界必然是百花齐放的，无论是专注于跨链的Polkadot，还是专注于稳定币的Luna，每个公链都有其独特点，22年各大公链生态的发展会成为一个主题。同样的，解决公链资产的跨链方案也会有前景发展。\nNFT 类项目 21年NFT火过也破碎过，在我看来NFT是一类很宽泛的项目，包括P2E、元宇宙、数字艺术品、头像等。这类项目目前还是属于比较新的，拥有较大的发展空间，但是这类项目也是最容易泡沫化的。因为过分新颖，所以没有可以参考的价格依据，从之前元宇宙炒房热就可以看出来，定价的不合理化成为很多投机者的热衷地。对于这类项目，要警惕，可以持续关注但是不要跟风，依旧通过「其是否解决了某项实际问题」作为出发点，来判断是否值得投资。\nMEV（矿工可提取价值） MEV是一直被大家所忽视的投资标的，因为很多人对MEV了解的比较小。MEV的具体细节我不过多描述，涉及到一些比较硬核的知识点，有兴趣地可以自己去了解。如何跟矿工做好资产分配，如何让用户和矿工之间达成友好协议是一个很大的问题，而问题背后隐藏着巨大的机会。\n域名 今年ENS的空投算是加密世界的一件大事，而域名的价值也开始被投资者认可。目前域名还处于早期阶段，它其实拥有很多可以挖掘的空间，将域名Defi化或者NFT化都是未来可行的方向，相信22年会有更多的项目投身于此。\n结语 感谢你能看到这里，这是对我的一种认可。2022年我对自己的期望就是尝试抓住一次百倍币的机会，并且学着用自己的一套理论搞出一个量化模型。很多人都说投资靠量化是不行的，不然那些科学家老早发财了，但是我觉得依托量化参数来辅助投资策略的实施确实是一条可行的道路。\n投资是一门值得学习一生的课程，愿你我都在这条路上走出自己的光彩，用知识武装自己，用信念走过牛熊。\n","permalink":"https://www.unclefish.link/en/post/2021%E9%B1%BC%E5%8F%94%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A/","tags":[],"title":"2021
